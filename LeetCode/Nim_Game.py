# You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.
# Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.
# For example, if there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game: no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.
# 策略在于，因为每个人都取不到4个，假设自己后走，要保证每轮自己和对方取得数量的和是4，这样就能确保每轮完后都有4的倍数个石头被取走。这样，如果我们先走的话，先把n除4的余数个石头拿走，这样不管怎样，到最后都会留4个下来，对方取1个你就取3个，对方取2个你就取2个，就必赢了。
